# üì¶ Optimizing FMCG Distribution for ITC Using Data Analytics  

**Internship Project | Indian Tobacco Company (ITC) | October 2021 ‚Äì December 2021**  

## üìå Project Overview  
ITC is one of the largest FMCG companies in India, traditionally relying on a **conventional distribution system** to deliver goods to **local kirana stores and supermarkets**.  

A startup, **StackBox**, aimed to **streamline this process** with a **technology-driven model**. Our objective was to analyze:  

‚úÖ **Which system (traditional vs. StackBox) performed better in terms of order frequency and customer retention?**  
‚úÖ **Whether ITC should develop its own digital distribution platform instead of using StackBox?**  

## üõ† Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Visualization & BI Tools:** Tableau  
- **Databases & Data Sources:** Sify, Excel, ITC Order Databases

## üîç Data-Driven Approach  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Collection & Cleaning:**  
   - Extracted and cleaned **order data** from **Sify, Excel, and SQL databases**.  
   - Standardized the dataset for comparative analysis.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Analysis & Insights:**  
   - Used **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** to analyze:  
     - **Order frequency** across both models.  
     - **Repeat purchases and retention rates** per shop owner.  
     - **Delivery efficiency & order fulfillment rates.**  
   - Executed **SQL queries** to extract specific trends from transactional data.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Shop Owner Preferences Survey:**  
   - Conducted surveys with **small business owners and kirana store managers**.  
   - Found that **most owners preferred the traditional system over tech-based solutions** due to familiarity and ease of use.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Tableau Dashboard & Stakeholder Presentation:**  
   - Designed **interactive visualizations** showcasing key metrics.  
   - **Final recommendation presented to ITC executives**, leading to **strategic business decisions.**

## Results & Business Impact  

‚úÖ ITC‚Äôs **traditional system had a higher repeat order rate** compared to StackBox.  
‚úÖ **Shop owners were hesitant to adopt a tech-based system** due to operational comfort with the manual process.  
‚úÖ Recommended a **hybrid approach** for ITC:  
   - **Use StackBox** for goods **arriving from outside the city to distribution docks**.  
   - **Retain the traditional system** for **last-mile delivery** to kirana stores.  
   - **Gradually introduce digital adoption** to shopkeepers through phased implementation.  
‚úÖ **Achieved a 10% increase in customer satisfaction** by optimizing the distribution strategy.  
‚úÖ **Stakeholder approval led to a phased adoption strategy** with potential expansion.
